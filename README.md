# Proj_15_DeepLearning_CIFAR_10

# Project Introduction

This project **Proj_15_DeepLearning_CIFAR_10** is primarily built for developing a deep learning model on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Its objective is to solve the image classification problem, which consists of images from 10 different categories.

## Purpose

- To use deep learning techniques for image classification.
- To train and evaluate models on popular datasets like CIFAR-10.
- To help students and researchers understand the basics of deep learning.

## Key Features

- **Dataset Loading**: The project includes code to directly download and load the CIFAR-10 dataset.
- **Model Architecture**: A model based on CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) has been developed.
- **Training and Testing**: Complete code is available to train and test the model.
- **Results Analysis**: The accuracy and loss of the model are analyzed.

## How to Use

 **Prerequisites:**
   - Python 3.x
   - TensorFlow or PyTorch library
   - NumPy, Matplotlib, etc.

 **Install:**
   
   pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
  

 **Run the Code:**
   - First, run the `main.py` or `train.py` file.
   - This code will download the CIFAR-10 dataset and train the CNN model.
   - After training, the model’s accuracy will be displayed on the test data.

 **View Results:**
   - Track accuracy and loss through logs or graphs.
   - Understand the model’s performance and tune hyperparameters as needed.
